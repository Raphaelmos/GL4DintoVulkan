# GL4DintoVulkan
Use GL4D and make a similar version but for Vulkan

GL4D = GL4Dummies

Interesting project to have a ton of tools used by OpenGL that got simplified for GL4Dummies to now get "transformed" 


Vulkan folder + a other one for the transformed based on existing GL4Dummies

## The vulkan folder is from a repository below the link :
